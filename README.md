# SocialDistanceMonitoring-using-YOLO-and-OpenCV
Social Distance Monitoring is very crucial in these pandemic situations. Initially Object Detection Method "YOLO" is used for identifying bounding boxes of people class alone and eliminating boxes below threshold confidence score and later non-max-suppression is implemented to eliminate overlapping bounding boxes. Later euclidean distance is used to measure distance between every pair of centroids and identify boxes that are closer to each other,marking these close boxes as Red and remaining boxes as Green

Yolo weights cannot be uploaded because of github limit. I will make them available to you through google drive link later.
